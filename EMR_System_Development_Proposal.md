# EMR System Development Proposal

## Proposal

### Project Overview
Develop a comprehensive electronic medical records (EMR) system using Ruby on Rails, inspired by the features of OpenEMR. This system will manage patient records, appointments, billing, prescriptions, and provide a robust platform for medical professionals to enhance patient care.

### Objectives
- Develop a secure, reliable, and scalable EMR system
- Ensure compliance with medical data privacy regulations
- Create a user-friendly interface for medical professionals
- Integrate features for patient management, appointment scheduling, billing, and prescriptions
- Enable interoperability with other medical systems and devices

### Target Audience
- Healthcare providers (hospitals, clinics, individual practitioners)
- Patients seeking efficient healthcare management
- Medical billing professionals

## Technical Plan

### Technology Stack
- Backend: Ruby on Rails
- Frontend: Vue.js (or React.js)
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Authentication: Devise (for user authentication)
- Authorization: Pundit (for user permissions)
- APIs: RESTful APIs for interoperability with other systems
- Testing: RSpec (for unit and integration tests)
- Deployment: Docker, AWS (for hosting and scalability)

### Core Modules
1. **User Management**
   - User roles: Admin, Doctor, Nurse, Receptionist, Patient
   - Authentication and Authorization
2. **Patient Management**
   - Patient registration and profile management
   - Medical history and records
3. **Appointment Scheduling**
   - Booking, rescheduling, and canceling appointments
   - Doctor's availability and calendar integration
4. **Medical Records**
   - SOAP (Subjective, Objective, Assessment, Plan) notes
   - Document storage (labs, scans, reports)
5. **Billing and Invoicing**
   - Insurance claims management
   - Patient billing and payment tracking
6. **Prescription Management**
   - E-prescriptions
   - Medication tracking and alerts
7. **Reporting and Analytics**
   - Customizable reports for patient data, billing, and appointments
   - Data export in various formats (CSV, PDF)
8. **Interoperability**
   - HL7/FHIR standards for data exchange
   - Integration with external labs and pharmacies

## User Stories

### User Management
1. As an admin, I want to create and manage user accounts, so that staff can access the system.
2. As an admin, I want to assign roles to users, so that they have appropriate access permissions.

### Patient Management
1. As a receptionist, I want to register new patients, so that their information is stored in the system.
2. As a doctor, I want to view and update patient medical histories, so that I can provide informed care.
3. As a patient, I want to view my medical records, so that I can stay informed about my health.

### Appointment Scheduling
1. As a patient, I want to book an appointment online, so that I can see a doctor at my convenience.
2. As a doctor, I want to manage my appointment schedule, so that I can see my daily and weekly appointments.
3. As a receptionist, I want to reschedule appointments, so that changes can be accommodated easily.

### Medical Records
1. As a doctor, I want to write and store SOAP notes for each patient visit, so that I can maintain detailed medical records.
2. As a nurse, I want to upload lab reports and scans, so that they are available for doctors to review.

### Billing and Invoicing
1. As a billing staff, I want to generate invoices for patient visits, so that payments can be processed.
2. As a patient, I want to view and pay my bills online, so that I can manage my healthcare expenses.

### Prescription Management
1. As a doctor, I want to create and send e-prescriptions to pharmacies, so that patients can get their medications easily.
2. As a patient, I want to receive notifications for medication refills, so that I donâ€™t miss any doses.

### Reporting and Analytics
1. As an admin, I want to generate reports on patient data and billing, so that I can analyze the performance of the clinic.
2. As a doctor, I want to view analytics on patient outcomes, so that I can improve my treatment plans.

### Interoperability
1. As a developer, I want to integrate the system with external labs, so that lab results are automatically imported into patient records.
2. As a doctor, I want to exchange patient data with other healthcare systems, so that I can provide coordinated care.
